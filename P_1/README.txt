The program file puts out the trade entries and exits with risk and reward in terms of points. The resulting file is Nifty_Pranay_1
The result analysis runs the result from the program file with 10 lakhs and 1% risked every trade. The resulting file with details of all trade is Nifty_Pranay_1_analysis. The summary of the system is stored in output.txt

Please note that I am not very confident about the ResulAnalysis file.
